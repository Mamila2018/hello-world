To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.
Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.
